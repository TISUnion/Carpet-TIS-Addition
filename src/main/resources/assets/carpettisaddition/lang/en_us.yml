              §lPoisson Distribution§r, determined by the offset origin point and the maxima point
              The random generator is implemented with the following steps:
              1. Make a poisson generator whose λ = §7<maxima>§r - §7<origin>§r
              2. Shift the probability density function in the positive direction of X by §7<origin>§r
              3. Done. Now the probability density function starts at x = §7<origin>§r, and has the maxima point at x = 7<maxima>§r
              The generated random real interval will be rounded to an integer and clamped to range [1, +∞), cuz after all, the player action interval is a positive integer
              If λ is greater than 50, it will be automatically replaced with an equivalent gaussian generator for better performance
              Optionally, you can specified a §7<upper_bound>§r for the random value. All values greater than the upper bound will be replaced with the upper bound
