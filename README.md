It reduces quite a lot of unnecessary iterating when an entity is moving and trying to search entities with hard hit box on the way, since the world is always not filled with boats and shulkers

Enable it before loading the chunk to make it work. ~20% performance boost in portal mob farms

## tooledTNT

Tools on the player's main hand is applied to item dropping during the explosion caused by the player

So you can ignite TNT to harvest blocks that require specific tool or enchantment as long as you are holding the right tool

For example, you can harvest ice with silk touch pickaxe, or harvest grass with shears

It also works for any other living entities beside player

Technically this rule applies the main hand item of the causing entity onto the loot table builder during the explosion

- Type: `boolean`  
- Default value: `false`  
- Suggested options: `false`, `true`
- Categories: `TIS`, `FEATURE`

# Command List

## raid

### list

`/raid list [<full>]`

List information of all current raids

### tracking

`/raid tracking [<start|stop|restart|realtime>]`

Start a raid tracking to gather statistics from ongoing raids


## info

### world ticking_order

`/info world ticking_order`

Show the ticking order of current dimensions in the game


## lifetime

A tracker to track lifetime and spawn / removal reasons from all newly spawned and dead entities

This tracker is mostly used to debug mobfarms. It aims to track the process from mob starting affecting the mobcap to mob being removed from the mobcap. The spawning tracking part of it doesn't cover every kind of mob spawning reasons

Other than being removed from the world, if a mob becomes persistent for the first time like nametagged or item pickup, it will be marked as removal too. If a mob doesn't count towards the mobcap when it spawns, it will not be tracked

This tracker also tracks lifetime of items and xp orbs from mob and block drops as an additional functionality. Note that it doesn't track all item / xp orb spawning, so you'd better have a test before actually using it

Adding a `realtime` suffix to the command will turn the rate result from in-game time based to realtime based

### tracking

`/raid tracking [<start|stop|restart>]`

Control the lifetime tracker

Tracked entity types:
- All kinds of mob (MobEntity)
- Item Entity
- Experience Orb Entity

Tracked entity spawning reasons
- Natural spawning
- Portal pigman spawning
- Trans-dimension from portal
- Spawned by item (spawn eggs etc.)
- Slime division (for slime and magma cube)
- Zombie Reinforce
- `/summon` command
- Mob drop (item and xp orb only)
- Block drop (item only)

Note that only entities that have been tracked spawning will be counted to the statistic 

Tracked entity removal reasons
- Despawn, including immediately despawn, random despawn, difficulty despawn and timeout despawn
- Damaged to death
- Becomes persistent. Note that the entity is still not removed from the world
- Rides on a vehicle (1.16+). Note that the entity is still not removed from the world
- Trans-dimension through portal
- Entity merged (item and xp orb only)
- Picked up by player (item and xp orb only)
- Collected up by hopper or hopper minecart (item only)
- Other (anything else not in the list)

The definition of lifetime is: **The amount of spawning stage passing between entity spawning and entity removal**, in other words, how many gameticks does the entity counts towards mobcap. Technically the injection point for the passing spawning stage counter increment is right before the world recalculating the mobcap

Statistics are sorted by the proportion of the amount 

### <entity_type>

`/lifetime <entity_type> [<life_time|removal|spawning>]`

Show the detail statistic of specific entity type. You can specify which part of the statistic will be output

For example, `/lifetime creeper` shows all statistic of creeper in detail, and `/lifetime creeper removal` only shows removal statistic of creeper in detail 


# Scarpet

## Functions

### `register_block(pos)`

Registers a block position to be tracked with events by scarpet. It is added to a global tracker (which you can view with
`is_registered()`). Blocks in this list will trigger events in `__on_microtiming_event` if they occur, independently of the loggers.
Returns `true` if block was not previously in list, and `false` if it was.

### `unregister_block(pos)`

Removes a block position from the list of block positions to be tracked. Returns `true` if block was previously in the
list, and `false` if not.

### `registered_blocks()`

Returns the list of block positions which are tracked by scarpet to trigger the block event events within scarpet.

### `is_registered(pos)`

Returns `true` or `false` based on whether or not that position is in the list of tracked block positions.

## Events

### `__on_microtiming_event(type, pos, dimension)`

This event will trigger any time any event that can be tracked with the loggers occurs on one of the blocks tracked by
scarpet, and that can be updated by the `register_block` and `unregister_block` functions. The type determines the type
of block event that occured, which can be one of: `'detected_block_update'`,`'block_state_changed'`,`'executed_block_event'`,
`'executed_tile_tick'`,`'emitted_block_update'`,`'emitted_block_update_redstone_dust'`,`'scheduled_block_event'` or 
`'scheduled_tile_tick'`

# Other Stuffs

- Set the maximum length of fake player's name to 16 to prevent kicking out other players
- Set the maximum `/tick warp` duration to `Integer.MAX_VALUE` for fabric-carpet before v1.4.18 (fabric-carpet v1.4.18 removed the `/tick warp` limit)
- Display the version of TIS Carpet Addition inside `/carpet` command
- Make carpet rule `tntRandomRange` works without carpet rule `optimizedTNT` or with lithium mod

# Development

Current main development branch: **1.15.2**

Current maintaining branches:
- 1.14.4, for Minecraft 1.14.4
- 1.15.2, for Minecraft 1.15.2
- 1.16.5, for Minecraft 1.16.2 to 1.16.5
- 1.17, for Minecraft 1.17 snapshots

Current archived branches:
- 1.16, for Minecraft 1.16 to 1.16.1

For general new features, implement them in 1.15.2 branch first then merge it into other branches

Branches merge order:
- 1.15.2 -> 1.14.4
- 1.15.2 -> 1.16.5 -> 1.17
- 1.15.2 -> master (when release)

For version specific fixes / patches, implement them in relevant branches

master branches usually only receives doc updates directly

Try not to affect version compatibility unless it's necessary

The English doc and the Chinese doc are aligned line by line btw
